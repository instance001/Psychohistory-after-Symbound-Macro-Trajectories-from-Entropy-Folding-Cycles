## Psychohistory-after-Symbound-Macro-Trajectories-from-Entropy-Folding-Cycles
| Term | Alternate term(s) | Alt map | External map | Relation to existing terminology | What it is | What it is not | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Psychohistory after Symbound | Symbound psychohistory | ~ | ~ | Macro-behavior model | Treats many vault→fold→capacity cycles across actors as drivers of macro trajectories; uses fold logs to forecast bursts | Not Asimov-style deterministic fate; empirical, falsifiable framing | Psychohistory-after-Symbound-Macro-Trajectories-from-Entropy-Folding-Cycles/paper.md |
| Burst cluster | burst | ~ | ~ | Macro event pattern | Periods of stagnation followed by sudden leaps emerging from aggregated fold cycles | Not steady exponential growth; not purely random | Psychohistory-after-Symbound-Macro-Trajectories-from-Entropy-Folding-Cycles/paper.md |
| Axis node | axis node | = | ~ | Influence point | Actor/team whose fold ordering disproportionately redirects neighboring trajectories | Not necessarily high-visibility leader; identified via burst influence scoring | Psychohistory-after-Symbound-Macro-Trajectories-from-Entropy-Folding-Cycles/paper.md |
| Cycle log schema | fold log schema | ~ | ~ | Data schema | `cycle_id, actor_id, vault_size, stall_start_ts, fold_ops, ΔM_estimate, insight_ts, project_count, new_vault_size` for publishing fold-aware datasets | Not a telemetry mandate; anonymization required | Psychohistory-after-Symbound-Macro-Trajectories-from-Entropy-Folding-Cycles/README.md |
